Recently I have to study how floating-point (FP) operations are implemented in hardware. Although I learned those in my undergrad computer organization course, my knowledge is kind of rusty now, especially for the concept on rounding (e.g., guard bit, sticky bit, etc.). 

I found [these lecture slides][fp-intro-slides] give a good intro, but the explanation of rounding is not clear to me. Therefore, I found [this note][fp-with-examples] useful because it comes with examples. [These slides][fp-impl-slides] cover the actual implementation of FP operations.
