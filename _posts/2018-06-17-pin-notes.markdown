Intel made a significant change of Pin from version 2 to 3. Users are forced to linked their tool with the provided [PinCRT][CRT]. However, it does not support features such as RTTI and modern C++11 that Pin 2.14 supports. To make Pin 2.14 run on newer Linux distributions, we have to make some changes.

## Makefile 
First, if you have gcc version > 5, the following patch needs to apply to the Unix makefile (`$PIN_ROOT/source/tools/Config/makefile.unix.config`). A related is reported [here][sst-issue].
```
343c343
<     TOOL_CXXFLAGS_NOOPT += -DTARGET_IA32E -DHOST_IA32E -fPIC
---
>     TOOL_CXXFLAGS_NOOPT += -DTARGET_IA32E -DHOST_IA32E -fPIC -fabi-version=2 -D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0
```

## Launching Command
It requires some special flags to make Pin 2.14 run on newer Linux kernel according to [this issue][zsim-issue]. 
Here is a list of launching commands and the Linux distributions on which I managed to let Pin work:

- Ubuntu 16.04:
    
    `$PIN_BIN -injection child -ifeellucky -t <your_tool.so> -- <app>`

- OpenSUSE LEAP 42.3:

    `$PIN_BIN -ifeellucky -t <your_tool.so> -- <app>`
